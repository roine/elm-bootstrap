When starting an ELM project I always end up writing the same boilerplate and configuring the same packaging system.
Elm boilerplate takes care of that for you.

Includes hot reloading

Usage
==
```bash
sh -c "$(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roine/elm-bootstrap/master/install.sh)"
```
Note: Few questions will be asked during the installation.

Once in the dir you created.
```bash
npm install && npm start
```
Start coding!
